## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16+ recommended)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or Atlas)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)


## Backend Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install

2. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory with the following content:

   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=3000

   - Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URI.

3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The server will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.


## Frontend Usage

- The frontend is served statically from the backend.
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to use the app.

## Development

- For hot-reloading during backend development:
  npm run server

  (Uses `nodemon`.)



## File Uploads

- Uploaded images/videos and profile pictures are stored in the `backend/uploads/` directory.
- You may need to create this directory if it does not exist.

## Environment Variables

- `MONGO_URI`: MongoDB connection string (required)
- `PORT`: Port for the backend server (default: 3000)
